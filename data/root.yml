  osc52copy:
    title: OSC 52 set - copy to clipboard
    description: This feature allow apps to set the clipboard content. A common usecase is to copy text from terminal editors.
  osc52paste:
    title: OSC 52 get - paste from clipboard
    description: |
      This feature allow apps to get the clipboard content. A common usecase is to paste text into terminal editors by
      using editor's mechanisms. Since it is considered a security hole to allow apps to read the clipboard
      and a trivial workaround exists (pasting with the terminal emulator itself) this feature is not enabled
      by default in many terminals.
  sixel:
    title: SIXEL graphics format
    description: The SIXEL format allows the terminal to display bitmap graphics.
